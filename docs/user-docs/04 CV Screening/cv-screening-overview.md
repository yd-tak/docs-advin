## 🏆 **1. What is CV Screening?**
CV Screening is the process of evaluating candidate profiles based on factors like:  
✅ Work experience  
✅ Education  
✅ Skills  
✅ Certifications  
✅ Language proficiency  

Advin uses AI to parse and evaluate CVs, then assigns a **CV Score** (0–100) based on how well the candidate matches the job requirements.

✅ **Goal:** Automate and accelerate the initial screening process.  

---

## 🧠 **2. How AI-Based CV Screening Works**
Advin’s AI follows a structured process to screen and score CVs:  

### 🔹 **(1) Text Extraction**  
Advin extracts raw text from the CV using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**.  
✅ Identifies structured and unstructured text  
✅ Detects tables, bullet points, and document formatting  

👉 **Example:**  
- Name: John Doe  
- Experience: 5 years in software development  
- Skills: PHP, Python, AWS  

✅ **Goal:** Convert the CV into structured data for analysis.  

---

### 🔹 **(2) Data Structuring**  
The AI processes extracted text and maps it into structured fields:  
✅ Name  
✅ Contact Information  
✅ Work Experience  
✅ Education  
✅ Skills  
✅ Certifications  

👉 **Example:**  
| Field | Extracted Data |
|-------|----------------|
| Name | John Doe |
| Experience | 5 years (PHP, Python, AWS) |
| Education | Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science |
| Skills | PHP, Python, AWS |

✅ **Goal:** Ensure all key data points are extracted correctly.  

---

### 🔹 **(3) Criteria Matching**  
Advin compares the extracted data against the job criteria:  
✅ Years of Experience  
✅ Degree and Field of Study  
✅ Technical and Soft Skills  
✅ Certifications  

👉 **Example:**  
| Job Requirement | Candidate Profile | Match (%) |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 3–5 years of experience | 5 years of experience | ✅ 100% |
| PHP, Python | PHP, Python, AWS | ✅ 100% |
| Bachelor’s in Computer Science | Bachelor’s in Computer Science | ✅ 100% |

✅ **Goal:** Identify how closely the candidate matches the job criteria.  

---

### 🔹 **(4) CV Scoring Calculation**  
Advin assigns a CV Score based on a weighted formula:  

**CV Score =**  
*(Relevant Work Experience × Weight) +*  
*(Education × Weight) +*  
*(Skills × Weight) +*  
*(Certifications × Weight)*  

👉 **Example:**  
- Relevant Work Experience = 30%  
- Education = 10%  
- Skills = 40%  
- Certifications = 20%  

➡️ **Final CV Score = 80%**  

✅ **Goal:** Generate an objective CV score for consistent evaluation.  

---

### 🔹 **(5) CV Score Threshold**  
Candidates who exceed the minimum score threshold are moved to the next stage.  

👉 **Example:**  
- Minimum CV Score = 60%  
- Candidate Score = 80% → ✅ Shortlisted  
- Candidate Score = 55% → ❌ Rejected  

✅ **Goal:** Automatically shortlist top candidates.
