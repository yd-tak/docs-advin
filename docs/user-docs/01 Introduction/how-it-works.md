## 🛠️ **Step 1: Create a Job Vacancy**
The recruiter starts by creating a job vacancy in Advin.  

### 🔹 **Required Details**

- Work Arrangement (On-site, Hybrid, Remote)  
- Commitment Type (Full-Time, Part-Time, Contract)  
- Work Location

### ✅ **Goal**  
Define the ideal candidate profile to enable AI scoring and filtering.  

---

## 📄 **Step 2: AI CV Screening & Scoring**
Once applicants submit their CVs, Advin begins the automated screening process.

### 🔹 **How It Works**  
1. Advin extracts raw text from the CV using OCR.  
2. AI processes the text and maps the information into structured data (name, work experience, education, skills, etc.).  
3. AI compares the extracted data to the job criteria.  
4. Candidates are assigned a **CV Score** (0 - 100) based on alignment with the job profile.  

### ✅ **Goal**  
Filter out unqualified candidates and prioritize high-potential applicants.  

---

## 🎙️ **Step 3: AI Interview**
Candidates that pass the CV screening are invited to an AI interview.

### 🔹 **How It Works**  
1. Advin creates an AI Assistant for each interview sequence.  
2. The Assistant conducts the interview by asking pre-defined questions.  
3. Candidate responses are analyzed in real-time.  
4. AI assigns a **Sequence Score** for each interview segment based on:  
   - Goal alignment  
   - Behavioral indicators  
   - Accuracy and completeness of responses  

### ✅ **Goal**  
Measure both technical knowledge and soft skills in a structured format.  

---

## 🔄 **Step 4: Final Scoring & Ranking**
Advin calculates a **Final Suitability Score** by combining the CV Score and Interview Score.

### 🔹 **How It Works**  
- Final Score = **CV Score** + **Interview Score**  
- Candidates are ranked based on their Final Score.  

### ✅ **Goal**  
Provide an objective ranking to help recruiters identify the best-fit candidates.  

---

## 🚀 **Step 5: Workflow Management**
Advin automates the processing of candidates through the hiring stages.

### 🔹 **How It Works**  
- Candidates are automatically moved to the next stage based on their score and status.  
- Recruiters can define custom workflows and hiring stages.  
- Notifications are sent for status updates.  

### ✅ **Goal**  
Ensure a smooth, automated, and efficient recruitment process.  

---

## 🏆 **Step 6: Hiring Decision**
Recruiters review the top candidates and make a hiring decision.

### 🔹 **How It Works**  
- Recruiters can review the detailed CV and interview performance.  
- Final Score and AI evaluation reports are available.  
- Candidates can be moved to “Hired” or “Rejected” status.  

### ✅ **Goal**  
Enable fast, data-driven hiring decisions.

## 🎯 **Example Workflow**
**Position:** Finance Accountant  
- CV Score = 85  
- Interview Sequence:  
   - Work Experience = 80  
   - Technical Knowledge = 90  
   - Role-Playing = 75  
- **Final Score = 85**  
➡️ Candidate ranked as a top performer and selected for the next step.
