# Managing Rejected Candidates

Advin provides a structured system for managing rejected candidates, including options to reprocess, archive, and follow up with unsuccessful applicants. This ensures that valuable candidates are not permanently lost due to temporary circumstances or scoring errors.

---

## 🏆 **1. What is Candidate Rejection Management?**
Candidate rejection management allows recruiters to:  
✅ Track rejected candidates  
✅ Provide feedback to unsuccessful applicants  
✅ Reprocess or reconsider rejected candidates  
✅ Store and archive rejected candidate data  

✅ **Goal:** Maintain a structured record of rejected candidates for future opportunities.  

---

## 🔎 **2. Why Managing Rejected Candidates is Important**
Even when a candidate is rejected, they could be a valuable resource for future positions:  
✅ They might improve their skills and reapply.  
✅ They might be suitable for a different position.  
✅ Keeping candidate records allows for better talent mapping.  

👉 **Example:**  
- A candidate scored 68% but missed the passing threshold of 70% → The candidate could be a strong fit for a future opening.  

✅ **Goal:** Build a talent pipeline by retaining candidate data.

✅ Is not selected after human interview  
✅ Rejects a job offer  

---

### ✅ **AI CV Screening Rejection**
- If CV Score < Minimum Score → Status = **Rejected**  
- Candidate receives automated rejection notification  

👉 **Example:**  
- Minimum CV Score = **70%**
