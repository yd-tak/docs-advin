# AI Interview Overview

Advin includes an advanced **AI-driven interview system** that automates the candidate evaluation process. The AI interview is designed to assess both **technical and soft skills** through structured questions and automated scoring.

---

## 🏆 **1. What is an AI Interview?**
An **AI Interview** is an automated interview process where Advin’s AI evaluates candidate responses based on:  
✅ Goal Alignment  
✅ Technical Accuracy  
✅ Soft Skills  
✅ Communication Style  
✅ Decision-Making  

Advin generates structured questions based on job requirements and evaluates candidate answers using predefined scoring criteria.  

✅ **Goal:** Automate and improve the consistency of candidate evaluation.  

---

## 🧠 **2. How AI Interview Works**
The AI Interview process in Advin follows a structured flow:  

### 🔹 **(1) Interview Creation**
- Recruiter defines the interview type and format  
- AI generates the questions based on job requirements  
- Recruiter sets scoring criteria and weight  

👉 **Example:**  
- Interview Type → **Technical + Behavioral**  
- Questions → **10 Questions**  
- Scoring → **Goal Alignment = 40%, Technical Accuracy = 40%, Soft Skills = 20%**  

✅ **Goal:** Ensure the interview reflects job-specific requirements.  

---

### 🔹 **(2) Candidate Invitation**
- Candidates receive an invitation via email or SMS  
- Candidate logs into the Advin portal  
- Interview must be completed within a defined time limit  

👉 **Example:**  
- Email sent to candidate → **24-hour expiration**  
- Candidate logs in and starts the interview  

✅ **Goal:** Provide a smooth candidate experience.  

---

### 🔹 **(3) AI-Based Evaluation**
Advin’s AI evaluates answers based on four key dimensions:  

| Evaluation Factor | Description | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Goal Alignment** | How well the answer addresses the question objective | "Describe your approach to managing a team project." |
| **Technical Accuracy** | Correctness and depth of the answer | "Explain how to optimize a SQL query." |
| **Soft Skills** | Communication style, tone, and clarity | "How would you resolve a team conflict?" |
| **Decision-Making** | Logical approach to problem-solving | "Describe a time you had to make a quick decision." |

👉 **Example:**  
- Goal Alignment → **85%**  
- Technical Accuracy → **90%**  
- Soft Skills → **80%**  
- Decision-Making → **75%**  

✅ **Goal:** Provide a consistent and objective evaluation of candidate responses.  

---

### 🔹 **(4) Scoring Calculation**
The AI assigns a weighted score based on the defined scoring structure:  

**Final Interview Score** =  
*(Goal Alignment × Weight) +*  
*(Technical Accuracy × Weight) +*  
*(Soft Skills × Weight) +*  
*(Decision-Making × Weight)*  

👉 **Example:**  
- Goal Alignment = 40%  
- Technical Accuracy = 40%  
- Soft Skills = 20%  

➡️ **Final Score** = (85% × 40%) + (90% × 40%) + (80% × 20%)  
➡️ **Final Score** = **86%**  

✅ **Goal:** Generate a balanced and fair interview score.  

---

### 🔹 **(5) Passing Threshold**
You can set a minimum passing score for each job type:  

| Job Level | Minimum Passing Score (%) |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Entry-Level** | 60% |
| **Mid-Level** | 70% |
| **Senior-Level** | 80% |
| **Executive-Level** | 85% |

👉 **Example:**  
- Minimum Passing Score = **70%**  
- Candidate Score = **86%** → ✅ **Pass**  
- Candidate Score = **65%** → ❌ **Fail**  

✅ **Goal:** Automate the filtering of unqualified candidates.
